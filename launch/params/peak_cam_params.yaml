# In this parameter file you can change acquisition settings of the camera. 
# Before that, you should try to open the camera with the ids_visioncockpit for an approximate setting

# To add more parameters to your camera please view the IDS Vision Reference at 
# https://de.ids-imaging.com/manuals-ids-peak.html 
# and modify acquisition_parameters.hpp and setDeviceParameters() function in peak_cam class

# choose which device to enter by entering its serial number here
# if you dont know it, run this node once and all serial nodes should be printed out

# ExposureTime in Î¼s
# limits the Acquisition Framerate
# When ExposureAuto is set to "Once" or "Continuous" the value won't be used
ExposureTime: 5000

# AcquisitionFrameRate in Hz
# WATCH OUT when AcquisitionFrameRate is too high there might be some latency. Check "rostopic hz /cameratopic"
AcquisitionFrameRate: 30

# ExposureAuto Setting 
# If ExposureAuto On set ExposureTime to any value ExposureTime [sek] < 1 / AcquisitionFrameRate [sek]
# Possible: ["Off", "Once", "Continuous"] as string! 
ExposureAuto: "Continuous"
